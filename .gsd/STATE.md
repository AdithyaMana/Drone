- Needs strict grid enforcement (4px/8px multiples only).
- Zero border radius policy.
- Requires custom text alignment techniques for React Native rendering (lineHeight adjustments, includeFontPadding: false).

## Current Issues/Blockers
- None.

## Next Steps
- Run `/plan 1` to detail Phase 1 (Foundation).
